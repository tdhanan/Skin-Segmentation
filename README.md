# Skin-Segmentation
The core objective of our project was to develop an efficient system that can accurately identify the dominant skin tone of users, thereby providing them with a precise assessment of their skin color.
Additionally, our project aimed to recommend suitable skin tone products based on the identified color. 
To accomplish this, we employed advanced techniques and algorithms such as thresholding and k-means clustering. 
It mainly focus on creating a dependable and effective solution that could assist users in achieving their skincare goals.
